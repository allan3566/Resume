Hello,I’ Allan. 
First of all, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today.
Based on the job description, think  I’m suitable and qualified for taking on  the role.

From my working experience, I know how to apply various tools like python or sql script to build diverse and complicate reports for different situations and stakeholders.
I also work with management team to set up the BI web platform which include all the reports we made.

During the project as I encounter the difficulty, first I will try to break down the problems to found out the core issue then solve the problem from users’ aspect.

Besides, I’m also a fast learner with a flexible mind., for example just within 3 months I’m able to build a practical ordering system by power app or apply different programs and RPA tools adeptly

Overall, I think I’m a reliable, diligent, person with passion on data science.
Thank you.
